	   <h2>My Biography:</h2>
	   
	   <p>Hello i'm Jasmine and I have a passion for all things creative. It started off with a passion for Fine Art and Design and Technology: Fashion Textiles which I took as A-Levels. Although I enjoy these areas, I realised that digital skills would help uplift this creativity as it could become transferable into a career. I therefore discovered the world of Digital Marketing and UX/UI design which has peaked my interest on this course, therefore there is a more heavy focus of this in the portfolio. I hope to dive more into these career paths in the near future, wherever that may lead me. Within this portfolio project I have focused on creating a company called 'Whispers Artistry' in which I can have a platform to sell these arts and crafts on my own and other websites, as well as posting and advertising on social media to build a community of like minded customers interested in my products. I chose this name as it has a relaxed feel to it and it shows that this is a company creating art. I will sell a range of products including paintings, drawings of different mediums, accessories, jewellery etc. Keep reading to find out more about this!</p>

	<h1>Previous Experience</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>A 'Display Technician' in a school in which a team of three of us were in charge of the displays around the school. We would take teachers requests for displays and design them on a digital design software. We would then format them as printable shapes, and then cut them out using a vynl cutter. We would then take down the previous display and put up the new display with paper and the vynl stickers we created.</li>
		<li>A weeks work in an opticians in which I transferred the sku codes of the products onto a barcode system. Once all the products sku's and descriptions were onto this new system, I used a barcode printer that was connected to the PC to print of the barcodes. I then stuck these onto the products so that the products could be simpily scanned via a barcode reader in the future to bring the product up on the system for payments faster.</li>
		<li>This 'Click Start' course in which I learned skills in Digital Marketing, User Experience/User Interface Design and Website Development. Examples of what I have created are shown on the 'portfolio pieces' page.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Although I haven't had lots of previous experience within the digital world yet, I plan to find much more in the future thanks to my new found passion in it!</p>
